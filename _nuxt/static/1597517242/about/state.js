The most interesting for development were the chat and products. This was because we worked with Laravel Echo, and for the first time solved the problem of how to send an image and make a preview of it; then we had to create an updatable list of all dialogs, where the conversation with a new message would move up. For me and the backend of the developer of products and categories was a dark forest, because we didn't understand how we could create a separate game inside which there would be a kind of products with dynamic fields, for example, where we had to save the in-game currency in which the price would be calculated according to the wishes of the customer, and in another category, we had to implement the type of \"service\".
